# About Curtis Preedom

Hello! I'm Curtis Preedom, a computer science student at the University of Colorado Boulder. My passion lies in robotics and software development, and I’m currently contributing to the CU RoboSub team, where I help design and implement software for autonomous underwater vehicles.

When I’m not coding or problem-solving, you’ll find me enjoying Colorado’s great outdoors. I love biking, hiking, disc golf, and skiing, embracing the adventurous spirit of the Rockies.

Feel free to connect and share ideas—I’m always excited to collaborate and learn!
